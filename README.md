# spring-mvc-hello-world


based on the spring framework 4.0 .
using the Marven 4.0.

# Notice :
1.each version of Spring have different config behavior . Don't try to correct the web.xml or *-servlet.xml by using spring un-compare version ,it's too complicated for the Jave Web Beginner.

2.Marven project can help you avoid using the incorrect jars. it's more convient by using the pom.xml than download the jars by your hands.
